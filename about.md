I am a PhD student in the [PINTS project](http://pauseparticles.org/) which focuses on pause-internal phonetic particles in speech communication. Within that project, I examine **phonetic aspects of breath noises, as well as their contribution to the production and perception of speech**. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html) and [Dr. Jürgen Trouvain](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~trouvain/).

I am part of the [Phonetics and Phonology research group](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/BM/phonetics/phonetics.html) headed by [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/moebius/members/bernd-moebius.html) within the department of [Language Science and Technology](https://www.lst.uni-saarland.de/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), Saarbrücken, Germany.
