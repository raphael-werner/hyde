I am PhD student in the [PINTS project](http://pauseparticles.org/) that focuses on pause-internal phonetic particles in speech communication. Within that project, I examine *phonetic aspects of breath noises, as well as their contribution to production and perception of speech*. My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/moebius/members/bernd-moebius.html) and [Dr. Jürgen Trouvain](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/%7Etrouvain/).

I am part of the [Phonetics and Phonology research group](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/) headed by [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/moebius/members/bernd-moebius.html) within the department of [Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/fachrichtung/lst/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), Saarbrücken, Germany.
