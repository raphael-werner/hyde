I am currently a research assistant at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and u](https://www.ru.nl/donders/), [Radboud Universiteit](https://www.ru.nl/), Nijmegen.
With [Wim Pouw](https://wimpouw.com/), I am working on several projects investigating the **biomechanics of speech and gestures**, more specifically the interplay of upper-body muscle activity, posture, and voice production.

Before that, I was a PhD student in the [PINTS project](http://pauseparticles.org/) which focused on pause-internal phonetic particles in speech communication. Within that project, I examined **phonetic aspects of breath noises, as well as their contribution to the production and perception of speech**. My supervisors in the [Phonetics and Phonology research group](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/BM/phonetics/phonetics.html) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html) were [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html) and [Dr. Jürgen Trouvain](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~trouvain/).
