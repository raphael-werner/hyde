title: Interspeech 2021 acceptance
---
It's been quite a while since I have posted on here (mainly because I used [twitter](https://twitter.com/verschallend) for announcing smaller updates) but there is some wonderful news concerning this year's Interspeech. Among the 6 papers from our department that were accepted were 3 papers from the PINTS project! They are:

<ul>
<li>Werner, R., Fuchs, S., Trouvain, J., & Möbius, B. (2021). Inhalations in speech: acoustic and physiological characteristics. Interspeech 2021, Aug 30 - Sept 03.</li>

<li>Muhlack, B., Elmers, M., Drenhaus, H., Trouvain, J., Van Os, M., Werner, R., Ryzhova, M., & Möbius, B. (2021). Revisiting recall effects of filler particles in German and English. Interspeech 2021, 30 Aug - 03 Sept.</li>
  
<li>Elmers, M., Werner, R., Muhlack, B., Möbius, B., & Trouvain, J. (2021). Take a breath: Respiratory sounds improve recollection in synthetic speech. Interspeech 2021,.</li>
</ul>

I'm looking forward to representing the pause-internals :)
