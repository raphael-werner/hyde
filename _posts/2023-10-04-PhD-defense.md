title: PhD Defense
---
On the 4th of October, exactly 5 months after submission, I defended my dissertation at UdS in Saarbr√ºcken.
It was logistically challenging, as I had moved to Frankfurt and started a new position in the Netherlands in the meantime.
I had been a bit nervous in the time leading up to it, but it all went better than I ever imagined.
The presentation went like clockwork, thanks to a practice run I did a week ago for the phonetics group and several practice runs my girlfriend was kind enough to listen to (big thank you!).
So this is a big recommendation of practicing!
The questions were all great and appreciative, from every person involved including the external reviewer and the chair.
For the aforementioned logistical situation, I had previously dallied with the idea of having it online.
I am very happy I did not end up doing that, as it was a wonderful end to my PhD time at UdS.
A massive thank you to everyone showing up -- colleagues, friends, and family -- and the committee for making this so enjoyable.
And for the awesome hat I got!
I am also extremely grateful who contributed to my PhD being such a lovely time!
