title: ISSP 2020

My last working week for this year, I was mostly busy with the [International Seminar on Speech Production](https://issp2020.yale.edu/) (ISSP). It was the last after a couple of online conferences (including occasional mixed feelings) in 2020 but I really enjoyed the format. Not only did they have the majority of contributions as poster presentations (which I think is much better than sitting through hundreds of short versions of talks), they also introduced double slots, i.e. every poster slot would happen twice which catered for different time zones but also allowed me to spend some more time on a sessions that was particularly interesting to me.

Personally, I was involved in a poster (*Exploring the presence and absence of inhalation noises when speaking and when listening* with J. Trouvain, S. Fuchs, and B. MÃ¶bius) and greatly enjoyed the discussions there and at other posters.

Overall, it was probably the online conference with the best format for me so far with some highly interesting talks, engaging discussions, and many things I could learn.
