title: ISSP 2020

My last working week for this year I was mostly busy with the [International Seminar on Speech Production](https://issp2020.yale.edu/) (ISSP). It was the last one after a couple of online conferences (including occasional mixed feelings) in 2020 but I really enjoyed the format. Not only did they hold the majority of contributions as poster presentations (which I think is much better than sitting through hundreds of short versions of talks), they also introduced double slots, i.e. every poster slot would happen twice which catered for different time zones but also allowed me to spend some more time on a session that was particularly interesting to me.

Personally, I was involved in a poster (*Exploring the presence and absence of inhalation noises when speaking and when listening* with J. Trouvain, S. Fuchs, and B. MÃ¶bius) and greatly enjoyed the discussions there and at other posters.

Overall, it was probably the best format I've seen in an online conference so far with some highly interesting talks, engaging discussions, an online concert, and many things I learned.
