title: Best student poster award at IAFPA 2022
---
I have recently been to the [summer school on complexity in speech production and perception](https://speechlabgroningen.nl/winterschool/) in Chorin and it was a lot of fun having a chance to talk to people that are doing similar or even completely different things! 
I think zoom etc. work well for a very purpose-driven exchange but just having a chat with other junior and established researchers is what I have been really lacking.
So thanks a lot for the organization!

The following week, we went on to [IAFPA2022](https://iafpa2022.ff.cuni.cz/) in Prague and had a great time there!
I hadn't known a lot about the fascinating world of forensic phonetics before that but I now know a little more about it.
And again, great people at the conference! The organizers also did a wonderful job at planning everything (I mean conference dinner on a boat going up and down the Vltava!?).
I also won best student poster award! It was awesome to see some people actually caring about what I do but the prize was a complete surprise to me, as visible in the picture. I had to run early to catch my train.

So again, wonderful events! Really looking forward for what's to come :) 
Also, I may have won something else earlier this year but I am waiting for something to happen first before I make an announcement here, so stay tuned!
