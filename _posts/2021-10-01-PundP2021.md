title: P&P 2021

This year's [P&P 17](https://www.linguistik-in-frankfurt.de/17-pp-in-frankfurt-gu/) in virtual Frankfurt is over and was a pleasure as usual.
Although I'm sure everyone's pretty tired of online conferences by now (yet some people still haven't learned what a mute button is), P&P was very enjoyable.
They based their infrastructure on last year's P&P who already did an extremely good job as one of the earlier online conferences.
The combination of zoom for talks and gather.town for poster presentations is a very good fit for smaller conferences in my opinion.

Personally, I got to see loads of interesting talks & posters and - through my PINTS glasses - it is wonderful to see that other people are working on breathing and/or pauses, too!
My poster on "Breath noise perception â€“ a pilot study on airway usage" was very busy (even had to go 20mins overtime) and there were some fruitful discussions and useful suggestions that I need to think about the next days.
