title: Some more news for 2022 (and a dog picture)
---
There's 2 more soon-to-be-happening conferences that I'll be at, namely [IAFPA2022](https://iafpa2022.ff.cuni.cz/) and [SMC2022](https://slp-nijmegen.nl/smc2022/):

<ul>
  <li>10-13 July, I will be in Prague at the 30th IAFPA, giving a poster presentation on an experiment did with Jürgen Trouvain and Bernd Möbius on "Speaker discrimination and classification in breath noises by human listeners". A picture of a very cute dog may have been involved to get participants motivated for the task.</li>
  <li>24-27 August, I will be in Groningen for the 8th International Conference on Speech Motor Control to present a poster on "Comparison of acoustic parameters of inhalations vs. exhalations with 3D-printed vocal tract models". It's coming from a really cool project that involves Susanne Fuchs, Jürgen Trouvain, Steffen Kürbis, Bernd Möbius, and Peter Birkholz and there is more from that to come, so stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
Since I got to attend Speech Prosody and a very cool [workshop on historical aspects of speech communication research](https://lacerda120.wordpress.com/), I am looking forward to more in-person events! It really is a lot different from the online experience.

Finally, since I promised a cute dog: here's the picture I used for the 'forensic' task along with a story that he had been kidnapped and all we have to find him are the kidnappers' breath noises.

His name's Dude (since he's a golden doodle) and he's not really missing. He's doing great and is a very good boy.
