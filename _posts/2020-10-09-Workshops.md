title: Workshops in early October 2020
---
If I had to come up with a positive aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, it'd have to be the accessibility of a number of workshops/courses/conferences that you normally wouldn't necessarily travel to or that wouldn't be open to the public. Therefore, making the best out of the current situation, within the past week, I got to attend a couple of workshops and courses from home:

The first one called [The Anechoic Chamber: Construction and Reception of Silence in Language, Literature, and History](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/ZiF/AG/2020/10-01-Mayar.html) at Uni Bielefeld approached the concept of silence from many different disciplines including literature, culture, and musicological aspects.

The second workshop was [Laughter and Other Non-Verbal Vocalisations Workshop](https://uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/linguistik-literaturwissenschaft/forschung/fachbereich/phonetik/laughter-workshop/) held at Uni Bielefeld as well. Here, the focus was much more on language and phonetic aspects of laughter and all sorts of non-verbal vocalizations. It came with a poster session (which as always was too short) and two great keynotes by Khiet Truong and Greg Bryant. My group from the PINTS project also presented two posters: the one I was involved in with JÃ¼rgen Trouvain you can find on the Publications section or on the conference website and the other one from Beeke Muhlack on the [project website](http://pauseparticles.org/) or again the conference website.

The third one that has been going on all week is a course on Voice technology given by Finnian Kelly of Oxford Wave Research organized by UZH Zurich. The course tackles the subject of speaker recognition from a technical point of view, shedding light on both the process of automatic speaker recognition and aspects of forensic speaker recognition. I am quite sure that everyone is enjoying the course as much as I am, as Finnian does an amazing job at explaining technical and complex matters in a comprehensible way.
