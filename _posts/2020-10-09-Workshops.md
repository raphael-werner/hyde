title: Workshops in early October 2020

Within the past week, I got to attend a couple of workshops:
The first one called [The Anechoic Chamber: Construction and Reception of Silence in Language, Literature, and History](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/ZiF/AG/2020/10-01-Mayar.html) at Uni Bielefeld approached the concept of silence from many different disciplines including literature, culture, and musicological aspects.
The second workshop was [Laughter and Other Non-Verbal Vocalisations Workshop](https://uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/linguistik-literaturwissenschaft/forschung/fachbereich/phonetik/laughter-workshop/) held at Uni Bielefeld as well. Here, the focus was much more on language and phonetic aspects of laughter and all sorts of non-verbal vocalizations. It came with a poster session (which as always was too short) and two great keynotes by Khiet Truong and Greg Bryant.
