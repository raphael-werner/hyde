title: Some acceptance news for 2022
---
I have some exciting news to share for this year (whose first month is already over apparently): I got accepted to a bunch of interesting things!
Chronologically, there are:
<ul>
  <li>2-4 March, I will be in virtual Sønderborg for [ESSV2022](https://event.sdu.dk/essv2022/main), giving a poster presentation on 2 experiments I did with Jürgen Trouvain, Beeke Muhlack, and Bernd Möbius on "Perceptual categorization of breath noises in speech pauses".</li>
  <li>23-26 May, I will be at the potentially in-person [Speech Prosody](http://labfon.letras.ulisboa.pt/sp2022/index.html), presenting a poster on "Optionality and variability of speech pauses in read speech across languages and rates", which I did with Jürgen Trouvain and Bernd Möbius.</li>
  <li>4-8 July, I will be at the very summery winter school on [Coping with the complexity in speech production and perception](https://speechlabgroningen.nl/winterschool/) in Chorin. Very much looking forward to hearing the talks there and talking to many interesting people!</li>
</ul>
Let's hope that the events currently planned as in-person events can be held as such!
