title: Best student paper award at ESSV 2022
---
Almost eight months ago, I participated in [ESSV2022](https://event.sdu.dk/essv2022/main).
Not only did my avatar do capoeira during the group photo, but I also won the award for best student paper!
I hadn't posted about it because I wanted to wait for the trophy and prize money to get here, so here it is:

It took a bit because of covid delay and on top of that, the apple had quite an odyssey, as there there's been some delivery problems related to street naming madness.
Anyways, I finally got it and I like it a lot! 
The little pedestal is 3D-printed and the apple, representing SDU's university logo, is wooden.
The paper that won the whole thing was on Perceptual categorization of breath noises in speech pauses and, as always, can be found in [Publications](/master/publications.md).
