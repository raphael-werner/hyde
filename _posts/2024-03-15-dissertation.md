title: Conferences in 2024
---
Work I have been involved in has been accepted to two conferences for the year 2024.
In May, **Movement-related muscle activity and kinetics affect vocalization amplitude** will be presented at [EVOLANG 2024](https://evolang2024.github.io/) in Madison, USA.
In July, we'll present **Arm movements increase acoustic markers of expiratory flow** at [Speech Prosody 2024](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024) in Leiden, NL.

Preprints for both can be found and accessed [here](https://raphael-werner.github.io/publications.html).
